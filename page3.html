<p>During my free-time, I like to do things I enjoy. One of my favorite hobbies is playing video games. To me video games are a way of escaping reality and doing things that you could never in reality.</p></div>

<p>When I turn on my console, there are a good amount of games I always look forward to playing. Some of my favorite titles are <span class="games">Overwatch, Smash Ultimate, and Rainbow Six Seige</span>. These games all have something in common, and that is that they are all super competitive. I love being matched up against a team and letting our skills decide who will prevail. </p></div>

<aside class="col-3-background" ><h2 class="headingFont-color">Top 4 Favorite Games:</h2>
	
<!-- this ordered list ranks my top 4 favorite games-->
<ol class="paragraphFont-color">
<li><p class="paragraphFont-color"><strong><u>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate:</u></strong> 
Smash Bros. is a game that I've enjoyed since I was a kid. I used to play it on the Game Cube with friends and it was a huge part of my childhood. When Smash Ultimate came out, I bought Nintendo Switch since I didn't have one yet and the game the day of release. I haven't had so much fun playing a game in such a long time so it was very refreshing to feel that high again.
</p></li>
	
<li><p class="paragraphFont-color"><strong><u>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</u></strong> 
<br />
Siege is a first-person shooter that shares some similarities with Overwatch. There is a big character roster and requires communication between teammates. There are two teams, the attackers and the defenders, and the objective is for the defenders to stop the attackers from, depending on the objective, capturing the hostage, planting and setting off the bomb, or capturing a certain area on the map. What really puts this game over many others is the enviromental destruction such as being able to blow up walls and floors, and make peek holes. This single attribute makes the game 10 times more competitive and fun which is why I love it so much.
</p></li>
	
<li><p class="paragraphFont-color"><strong><u>Overwatch:</u></strong> 
<br />
This game is a team-based first-person shooter that requires communication between teammates and individual skill to win. There is currently a 30-character roster that players can choose from and each character has a different playstyle. Trying to climb from the bronze rank all the way up to platinum, diamond, masters, and above is one of the many things I enjoy about this game.
</p></li>

<li><p class="paragraphFont-color"><strong><u>Darksouls:</u></strong> 
<br />
Dark Souls is one of the most rage inducing games ever made when you first start playing. What makes it so angering is the fact that you will die at least 50 times when going through your first playthrough, but, that's one of the reasons why I love it so much since it makes you try to learn from your mistakes and try fighting with a differnet approach until you finally win that one fight you have been struggling with for the last 30 minutes or so.
