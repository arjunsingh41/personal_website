<h2 id="myHeader" style="font-family: 'Concert One', cursive;">Goals During College</h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">During the short amount of time I have studying in Penn State, I set a few goals that I hope to achieve by the end of the day of my graduation. I want to be able to raise my GPA up to at least a 3.7 and to be able to make this possible, I study 4 times as much as I used to in my previous semesters. I also hope to be able to land an internship so I could be able to have some experience and have a sneak peek of what my future will look like a few years from now. My biggest goal is to never lose hope and to always stay optimistic no matter what since hope is what fills my gas tank and keeps me going everyday.</p>

<h2 style="color:#3B7F26;font-family: 'Concert One', cursive;">Goals During Career</h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">My biggest goal right now is to help program a video game for a big company like Nintendo and Rockstar. To be able to do this I need to learn programming languages that are often used when developing games such as C++, C#, Java, and Python. I also want to be able to make enough money to support myself. These are all the goals I have right now, but I certainly will have many more when I start my career.</p>
