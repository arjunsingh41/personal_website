<h2 id="myHeader" style="font-family: 'Concert One', cursive;">Programming</h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">When I was learning about Java, I created many programs but the two that I loved the most were my U.S. Dollar to Japanese Yen conversion program and my tic-tac-toe program. The conversion program made me use the most math yet on a program. The tic-tac-toe program was hands down the most difficult one I've done yet but it was very rewarding after getting it to work. </p>

<h2 style="color: #3B7F26; font-family: 'Concert One', cursive;">Skills I've Learned</h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">When I was first introduced to Java, I was very confused because it was the first time ever doing anything programming related. After writing my first "Hello World!" code, I felt very confident and found out that coding was going to be easier than what I first imagined it to be. I later learned about concepts such as arrays, loops, methods, cases, subclasses, and switches. </p>
